![module-map](https://intel.github.io/Edk2Code/images/module-map.png)

This feature is helpful in visualizing how a module includes various libraries. It also provides insights into how C files within the module include header files. By understanding these relationships, developers can better manage dependencies.

## [Error Detection](https://intel.github.io/Edk2Code/advance_features/#error-detection)

The DSC analysis can identify potential issues within the DSC files, such incorrect paths, duplicated libraries, etc. These issues are highlighted and shown in the Visual Studio Code "Problems" window.
